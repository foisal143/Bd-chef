        The ‘Pig n Whistle’ is a modern British style pub situated in the
        Kapparis section of the vibrant food district in Paralimni. It serves
        the surrounding area including Protaras and Ayia Napa and it’s not just
        for the Brits, coz you get loads of locals and international tourists
        here, so it’s probably because it looks so inviting. Outside there’s a
        lovely terrace, all wooden tables and benches, inside it’s big and
        spacious, with comfortable seating, an awesome menu, loads of
        blackboards and signs, 9 big TV screens showing all the live sports,
        often 4 or 5 games at the same time on Saturday, including the Cypriot
        games and the atmosphere and the banter is absolutely awesome!
